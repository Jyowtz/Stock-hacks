## What Does Investopedia Trading do?
Investopedia Trading asks you to enter the stocks you're interested in to calculate their expectancies (a measure to show which stocks are gonna make you more money and less risky).
It also shows you stock data and after you choose the stocks that you wanna trade, you can execute the trade from the program automatically. Also, upon clicking "Execute trade" a 
new record on your notion database (trading journal) is added automatically.
