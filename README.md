A GUI python program made for beginners in the automation of trading. It calculates expectancies of stocks (measures which stocks are less risky and are expected to make more money), shows stock data and graphs and recommends the number of shares to buy according to many variables determined by the user. After choosing stocks, trades can be executed from the program automatically.

## How to Use Investopedia Trading?
### First Stage
Upon running the program, you get this window which asks you about the **risk percentage**: how much of your cash are you ready to lose on a single trade? Risk percentage is often 2% if you have much cash. On the other hand, people with less cash tend to increase it to 5%. If you uncheck 2%, you can enter your own risk percentage. Secondly, the program will ask you about the chance of winning which is set by default to 0.9 to all stocks. If you uncheck it, you'll have to enter winning chance to each individual stock. Thirdly, below the two checkboxes you'll find the account value and cash. These values are scraped from your Investopedia profile.

### Seocnd Stage
Then, you'll have this window for each stock that you're interested in. The first entry is for the ticker (symbol) of the stock. The second is for the target price (the price that you think the stock will reach). The third entry is for the stop loss price (the price at which you accept your loss and exit the trade.) If you've got more stocks that you're intersted in, then you can press "Onto the next stock" button. If this is the last stock, then you can press "finish" to display the results.

### Third Stage
After you enter the stocks you're interested in, the results are displayed and the stocks are ranked descendingly according to expectancy. You get to choose the type of order (either market or limit order) and also specify the price of the limit order (the limit price is by default `current price Â± 0.02`). The number of shares that are to be bought/ shorted is displayed. The number of shares is calculated through the following rule: `position size (number of shares) = Max loss per trade/ amount you can lose per share` or in other words: `position size (number of shares) = quantity = account value * (risk percentage / 100) / (|current price - stop loss price|)`.
